# Vulnerable-Driver-Manual-Mapper
This repository contains C++ code to load custom drivers by exploiting a vulnerable driver in Windows. This project demonstrates a technique to bypass DSE (Driver Signature Enforcement) and PatchGuard using a vulnerable driver, and to load a custom driver. It serves as a proof of concept for security research purposes.
